# Performing-Incident-Response-and-Forensic-Analysis

## Objective
In this lab, I will imitate the Analysis step of the incident response process. I will analyze a PCAP file and disk image for evidence and then prepare your findings in an incident response report. I will then continue my investigation and update my report as more evidence comes to light.
### Skills Learned
- Perform forensic analysis as part of an incident response investigation.

- Perform forensic analysis on a PCAP file using NetWitness Investigator.

- Perform forensic analysis on a disk image using Autopsy.
- Correlate evidence from multiple sources to develop your case.

- Create an incident response report to document your findings.
